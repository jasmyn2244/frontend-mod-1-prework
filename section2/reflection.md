## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I'm somewhere in between. Especially in school, I hope to be able to bounce around questions with real people who know more than me. That, to me, is the definition of school and why I'm paying $20,000 to attend Turing.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- Honestly, I didn't notice a difference between this section and section 1. I found the directions for running a file in node to be incomplete and confusing and ended up figuring it out on my own anyway. I also see contractions between the video we watched where it said don't include a semi colon after a function and the code example in functions.js where a semi colon was included. I'm also confused that the commit messages include capitol letters after the first letter. I was told in Mod0 that only the first word is capitalized in a commit message. Maybe these are style choices, but for someone with no experience it gets a little confusion. Sometimes it can be uncomfortable because I need something explained a different way to understand, but I know I can reach out on Slack so that is reassuring.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- Conditional statements tell a computer what to do based on certain information. The computer will do something different depending on the conditions given. I wonder if conditionals are used when entering data into fields. If it's a real email, turn green. If it's not a real email, return the statement, please enter a valid email.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- Add multiple conditions using 'else if'. The computer will run through each condition in order. If the first condition is met, it will run the code for that condition, and if not, it will move on to the next condition or 'else if' statement.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- Logical Operators
- && indicates that both conditions are met. Think "and"
- || indications that 1 of two conditions are met. Think "or"

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- I wasn't able to get an || logical operator to work in one of my functions, so I'm looking forward to seeing better examples of that.
