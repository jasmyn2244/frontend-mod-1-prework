## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- I love the idea that a growth mindset allows us to be more gentle with our mistakes, receive feedback more openly and enjoy the learning process.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

 Ways I do:
- It used to be really important to me to be identified as smart. Now I'm just interested in learning
- If I make mistakes, they don't determine my ability, they will give me opportunities to learn

 Ways I don't:
- Becuase coding is so new, sometimes I find myself wonderfing if I'm going to be 'good' at it, I need to shift to how well can I learn coding?

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Arrays can hold any information that is related. In the lesson, Instagram is used as an example. Each persons posts are stored in an array. I wonder if menu items are stored in arrays? I also wonder if images are stored in arrays?

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
It's a function or process that is built into JavaScript that allows us to get imformation about or manipulate our arrays without writing our own funcitons from scratch. For example: array.length will return the number of items in the array. We also talked about pop, push, shift, and unshift. There are many more.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
Loops iterate through data sets. They repeat an output or a process until we tell it to stop. It saves us so much time and allows us to start taping into the power of the computer to do things that would take a lifetime to do manually. If we need to interact with items in an array, we would use a loop with the array. We may want to list the items or list the items with a message or perform a math function with the item in the array. Without an array, loops simply repeat a process or output a designated number or times

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
Loops tell the computer to do something over and over and tells it how many times.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Wondering what a real life loop looks like to make a meaningful feature.
