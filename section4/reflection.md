## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

 - Pomodoro technique was valuable. I found myself feeling driven to work really hard with a lot of focus to see if I could hit my intention during the 25 mins. It was really hard to get myself to stop and take the break, but it felt good to get out of my head and check in with my body, get water, and relax.


1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in
  Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  - I found myself feeling driven to work really hard with a lot of focus to see if I could hit my intention during the 25 mins. I also notices when I felt the impulse to check my phone messages, but held off until the break.


1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  - An object is similar to an array in that it can store multiple pieces of information. But it can hold more complex information that can be accessed differently than information in an array which sits within an index or an ordered list. The information in an object can be a string and therefore can be accessed differently.



1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - array
    - It's a simple list
  * List of states and their capitals
    - object
    - this sounds like key/value pairs
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - array
    - it's a simple list
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - array
    - sounds like a simple list
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - object
    - this sounds like key/value pairs
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - object
    - sounds more complex than a list
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - array
    - simple list of items

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

  - I don't know if this is a good real life example, but I wonder if you go to a cooking page and there is a list of recipies, if you click on a certain recipe, the page will display the ingredients and recipe. These could be values attached to the key of the recipe title?


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

  - I'm still wondering about puting functions straight into the constructor. I'm also wondering how define values in the constructor work differently than the perameters.
